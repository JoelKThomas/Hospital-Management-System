HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM-MEDICAL MISSSION

INTRODUCTION:
Hospital plays a major role in a human's life. There is no human on earth that is not going to be suffering some sort of sickness.

Medical Mission is based on the idea of providing the automated system. It saves time and extra overhead to perform the action. This can assist patients wherever they want, whenever they want. They do not have to wait in the line for hours.

In today's system records of the doctors, patients, nurses and other staffs are maintained on the paper. This is not very effective, is not reliable and is very time comsuming process.  So with this project we aim to minimize the paperwork of the hospital as minimum as possible, if not completely.
 
TECHINICAL PART:
It will contain four main modules: Admin, Doctor, Patient and Visitor.
Admin will be the system administrator who keeps the record of the clinic intact. He can personalize the users profiles.
Visitors are unregistered user in the system, who can view hospital details, how to contact them etc.
Any new Patient is first registered in the database prior to meet the doctor. Full description about the patient about personal detail and phone number and then disease and what treatment is going on.  Also each Doctor will have unique id.

The Doctor can update the data related to patient upon diagnosis (Including the disease diagnosed and prescription).
